## How We Store Your Information

### Local Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device:

- **Keychain Storage**: Your authentication credentials, user profile, and Apple Sign In tokens are stored securely in the iOS Keychain, which uses hardware-encrypted storage.

- **UserDefaults**: Charter data, checklist progress, and app preferences are stored in UserDefaults on your device.

- **Cache Directory**: Educational content and images are cached locally for offline access. Cache entries expire after 7 days.

### No Cloud Storage

**Important**: Currently, we do not sync your data to any cloud service. All data remains on your device. This means:
- Your data is not backed up to our servers
- Your data will be lost if you delete the app or lose your device
- Your data is not accessible across multiple devices

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

1. **Provide App Functionality**: Enable charter management, checklists, and learning features
2. **Personalize Your Experience**: Customize content and features based on your profile and preferences
3. **Maintain App Security**: Authenticate your identity and secure your account
4. **Improve the App**: Understand how you use the app to enhance features and fix issues
5. **Content Delivery**: Fetch and cache educational content for offline access

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Sign In

We use Apple Sign In for authentication. When you sign in:
- Apple provides us with your Apple User ID and optionally your email and name
- We do not receive your Apple password
- Your relationship with Apple is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy

### GitHub

We fetch educational content from a public GitHub repository (`dikology/captains-locker`):
- We access publicly available markdown files and images
- No authentication is required to access this content
- We do not send any personal information to GitHub
- Content requests are subject to GitHub's rate limits

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:

1. **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or in response to valid legal requests
2. **Service Providers**: If we engage third-party service providers in the future, we will update this policy accordingly

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information:

- **Keychain Encryption**: Sensitive data is stored in iOS Keychain with hardware encryption
- **Local Storage**: All data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers
- **Secure Authentication**: We use Apple's secure authentication protocols

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Control

You have the right to:
- **Access Your Data**: View all data stored in the app through the app interface
- **Update Your Information**: Modify your profile, charters, and preferences at any time
- **Delete Your Data**: Delete your account and all associated data by signing out and deleting the app

### Data Deletion

To delete your data:
1. Sign out of the app (this removes authentication data from Keychain)
2. Delete the app from your device (this removes all UserDefaults and cached data)

**Note**: Once you delete the app, all your data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered, as we do not maintain cloud backups.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.

## International Users

If you are using the App from outside the United States, please note that your data is stored locally on your device and is subject to the laws of your jurisdiction.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.

## Data Retention

We retain your data only as long as:
- You continue to use the App
- The data is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy
- You have not deleted the app or signed out

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you control data retention by keeping or deleting the app.
